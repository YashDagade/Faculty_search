With a special focus on algorithms impacting societal decision-making, his work addresses societal challenges through the lens of computational social choice and fair division. Ariel is particularly interested in projects that not only delve into theoretical concepts but also have direct real-world applications. His innovative approach has led to the creation of websites like Spliddit, which helps individuals tackle everyday fair division problems, and Panelot, which facilitates the random selection of citizens’ panels for more democratic governance.
